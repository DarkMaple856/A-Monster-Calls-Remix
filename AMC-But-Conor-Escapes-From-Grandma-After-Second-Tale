Chapter 1: Escapism 101

"What have you done?" Conor yelled out to the air, as if believing by doing so, he would get answers.
But no answers came.
Snapping out, he realised that he had to act quickly.
Once his grandma's car pulled into the driveway, all would be lost.
Taking advantage of the precious time he had, Conor packed whatever he might need into his rucksack.
Creeping out, Conor started running, enveloped under a shroud of darkness.
He could see lights from his grandma's house, screams and shouts, but he didn't dare look back.
Running faster than he had ever done before, Conor burst into his house, the one with the yew tree.
Continuing his frenzied packing, Conor ran out and away before anyone was the wiser.

Chapter 2:
Never gonna give you up plays in the background and Conor was strolling casually out from his home.
He had no idea what he needed to do, but for now, he had escaped the horrors he might have otherwise 
had to face back at that hell of a home. He took a seat and began reading a Monster calls to see
what he could possibly do next. The technology was so advanced they got the book out even before 
publishing and this helped Conor realise he had to go the abandoned shed. What he didn't read was
that he would there meet Shrek , his god.

" CONOR YOU HAVE BETRAYED ME!" out of the blue, the yew trë appeared, raging. " HOW DARE YOU WORSHIP SHREK NOT ME!"
